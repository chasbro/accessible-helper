Gives feedback to authors about the accessibility problems of their posts and pages.

== Description ==

The Accessible Helper plugin helps content authors understand what accessibility problems exist on a page, and what they can do to fix those errors. It keeps track in metdata of posts how many errors exist for that post, and can show a list of all errors, or a highlighted version of the post with errors outlined and prefixed with help icons.

== Installation ==

The plugin requires the open-source QUAIL (QUAIL Accessibility Information Library) before it can be enabled. To download the library go to http://quail-lib.org and download the latest release. Unpack the library folder and rename it to plain 'quail' (i.e. from 'quail-lib-0.4' to just 'quail') and place it in the accessible_helper plugin folder.
